Digit Recognition using convolutional neural network
This is a project tha utilizes the Keras Deep Learning library
to train a convolutional neural network on the MNIST dataset, which 
has an accuracy of around 98%.
Then the neural network is used to predict a user's drawn digit(0-9)
using the mousepad. The user draws the digit on a simple GUI made using
Tkinter.
